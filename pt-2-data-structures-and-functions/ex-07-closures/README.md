## ▶️ **2.7 — Closures**

**Task:**
Write a complete Go program that:

* Defines a **closure** that returns a function `next()`
* Each call to `next()` returns successive integers: `1`, then `2`, then `3`
* Calls `next()` three times
* Prints each returned value

**Constraints (per Go by Example):**

* Use a closure capturing state
* Do **not** use global variables
* Use `fmt.Println`
* Program must compile and run

**Submit a complete Go file.**

⏳ Awaiting your submission for **2.7**.
