## ▶️ **3.11 — Interfaces & Embedding**

**Task:**
Write a complete Go program that:

* Defines an interface `Describer` with **one method**
* Defines a struct that **implements** this interface
* Demonstrates **struct embedding** with another struct
* Calls the interface method and prints its result

**Constraints (per Go by Example):**

* Interface satisfaction must be implicit
* Use embedding via anonymous fields
* Use `fmt.Println`
* Program must compile and run

**Submit a complete Go file.**

⏳ Awaiting your submission for **3.11**.
