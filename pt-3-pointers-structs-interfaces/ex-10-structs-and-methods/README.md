## ▶️ **3.10 — Structs & Methods**

**Task:**
Write a complete Go program that:

* Defines a struct

  ```go
  type Circle struct {
      r float64
  }
  ```
* Defines a method

  ```go
  func (c Circle) Area() float64
  ```

  that returns π × r²
* Instantiates a `Circle` with radius `10`
* Prints the result of calling `Area()`

**Constraints (per Go by Example):**

* Use a method with a receiver
* Use `math.Pi`
* Use `fmt.Println`
* Program must compile and run

**Submit a complete Go file.**

⏳ Awaiting your submission for **3.10**.
