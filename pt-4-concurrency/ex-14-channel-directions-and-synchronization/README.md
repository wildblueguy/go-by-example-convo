## ▶️ **4.14 — Channel Directions & Synchronization**

**Task:**
Write a complete Go program that:

* Declares:

  * a **send-only** channel parameter
  * a **receive-only** channel parameter
* Demonstrates correct use of each direction
* Sends a value from one goroutine and receives it in another
* Prints the received value

**Constraints (per Go by Example):**

* Use directional channel types (`chan<-` and `<-chan`)
* Use goroutines
* Use `fmt.Println`
* Program must compile and run without deadlock

**Submit a complete Go file.**

⏳ Awaiting your submission for **4.14**.
